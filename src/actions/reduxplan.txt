//call API Results at the outset?
//the search submit function filters the result to redner
//however, API isn't called at each search
//benefit: UUID remains constant over each search?
// don't use this idea, it's non-performant (sic) compared to below.





//why do we need static UUIDs? for favorites.
//if we search/re-search, the favorite list should remain as is.

//plan: compare the 'favorite list' against the new 'search results' list
//compare by contents (body,title, category, keywords,id[if exists])
//  search by id first for quickness
// if matching, assign the new id to the result

//Expected actions to address:
//~Search~
//     update search value
//     return results
//          filter results

// ~Favorites~
//     add favorite
//     remove favorite
