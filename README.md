## Shopify 2019 Web Engineer Internship Posting

### Context: 
+ Shopify had a job posting for their summer internship program.
+ Applicants should follow the user requirements & match the provided design.

After the deadline for the posting expired, I took it as a fun 1-day build project.

### Functionality:
+ User can search against the Toronto Waste JSON file for how to handle their types of trash.
+ Results returned match on the 'keyword' file
+ User can star a specific (or multiple) result to add to their Favourites (sic**) list.
+ Green star = toggled on, grey star = toggle off.
+ Favourited items are shown below the results, and remain while user can continue to search
+ Un-starring a Favourite item removes it from the list, and [still not there...] the matching Result item star should correspond.


### Project Set-up:
+ Download repo

` npm install` to add dependencies

` npm start`  to post to local host

+ Alternatively, just open it through the CodeSandbox link.




** I'm in the US. The posting was in Canadian English.
